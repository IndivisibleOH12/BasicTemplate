Indivisible groups from Ohio Congressional Districts 3, 12, and 15 organized a Vigil for the Vulnerable on July 8.  This was part of a statewide action designed to bring attention to the impact of the proposed changes to the ACA (BRCA) on the most vulnerable Ohioans: children, people with disabilities, the elderly, and those with pre-existing medical conditions.

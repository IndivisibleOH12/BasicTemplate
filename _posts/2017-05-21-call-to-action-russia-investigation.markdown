  Hi, I'm [NAME], a constituent from [CITY, ZIP]. I'm calling about the investigation into the Trump adminstration's ties to Russia. I'm pleased about the DOJ's apppointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel, but I want Congress to step in as well. Please urge [Senator/Representative NAME] to publicly and legislatively demand the creation of an independent, bipartisan commission. I don't want partisan politics or the Trump Administration's influence to bias the investigation, and I think the public has a right to know the full extent of Trump's involvement with Russia, even if special counsel deems that are no crimes to prosecute. A commission modeled after the 9/11 commission will provide the level of transparency that the American people deserve. Please ask [Senator/Representative NAME] to follow up with me. Thank you!

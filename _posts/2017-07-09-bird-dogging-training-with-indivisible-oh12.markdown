Join Indivisible OH12 for a bird-dogging training session at Northwest Library on July 19 from 7 to 8:30 pm.  (Northwest Library's address is 2280 Hard Rd, Columbus, Ohio 43235) 

This training will cover what bird-dogging is, why it is an effective tactic (even though it is aggressive and can push people's comfort zones), and how to build a team to pull off an effective bird-dogging action.

We also will include time to practice, including a role-play scenario, and will have some work on effective livestreaming on Facebook as well as other social media.

Even if you're not a member of Indivisible OH12, we welcome guests from other Indivisible and progressive groups!

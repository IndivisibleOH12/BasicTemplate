Please join Indivisible Ohio District 12 and Indivisible Columbus District 3 & 15 for a Town Hall on the State of American Democracy: Which Way Forward? This event will be a show of force to let Tiberi and Portman know we are still paying attention, and we are not backing down! 

Bring your questions for Tiberi, Stivers and Portman! Their voting records will speak for them, plus we will have a panel of experts ready to answer your questions on topics such as the Russia Investigation, National Security, Healthcare reform, Immigration, and the way forward for our Democracy. We will also hear stories from our Ohio neighbors who have been harmed by the Trump Effect, and learn what we can do to help. All Central Ohioans are welcome to join us.

Please spread the word, and RSVP, so we know how many to expect! 

We will also:
HELP OUR NEIGHBORS: by collecting food items for the Our Lady of Guadaloupe Food Pantry. They especially need dried beans, rice, tuna, salt, sugar, canned corn, oatmeal and cereal. They could also use soap and toothpaste.

LEARN AND TAKE ACTION: our activist fair will allow you to learn about groups that share our values and mission and take immediate action. Plan to come a little early - the fair will open at 4:30 or stay a little late.

HAVE FUN! Vocal Resistance will be performing and lead us in a song.

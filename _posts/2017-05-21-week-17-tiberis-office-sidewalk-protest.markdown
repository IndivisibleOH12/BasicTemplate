For the second week running we will deliver our invented versions of certificates of "Request for Admissions" and "Interrogatories." These are legal documents similar to subpoenas that demand the recipient admit things that are true and answer questions. Come with your demands and questions for your Representative!

This will be # 17 of our weeky visits to Pat Tiberi's office! He won't hold a town hall and talk to us, so we go to him. We stand outside his offfice for about 30 minutes every Thursday at noon. Then we go inside and deliver our postcards or other documents and talk to Tiberi staffers about how Pat is not representing his constituents: he voted for the AHCA, he isn't standing up against Trump, and he fails to represent us on numerous other issues. Join us. We are super friendly!

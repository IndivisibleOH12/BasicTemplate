Send your thoughts about the AHCA (the ACA repeal) to HealthReform@Finance.Senate.gov. 

Once you're done, get more bang for your time by tweeting out your response with the #AHCA and #LetOhioLive and #OH12 tags, turning it into a Letter to the Editor, or using ResistBot to send it to Portman and Tiberi.
